# SMARTLAGOON Buoy Data Repository

This repository stores and provides access to the environmental monitoring data collected by the **SMARTLAGOON Buoy**, deployed in the **Mar Menor** coastal lagoon. The buoy is part of the **SMARTLAGOON** project, an initiative funded by the **European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement No. 101017861)**. 

## üìå About the SMARTLAGOON Project

**SMARTLAGOON** (Innovative Modelling Approaches for Predicting Socio-Environmental Evolution in Highly Anthropized Coastal Lagoons) is a Horizon 2020-funded project that integrates **real-time environmental monitoring, machine learning models, and social sensing** to assess and predict socio-environmental changes in the Mar Menor lagoon (Murcia, Spain).

The **SMARTLAGOON Buoy** contributes to the project‚Äôs objectives by **continuously measuring water quality and meteorological parameters**, providing valuable data to support **hydrodynamic and ecological modeling**, as well as **policy-making for sustainable lagoon management**.

## üìä Data Description

The dataset includes **meteorological and water quality measurements** collected by the buoy at **hourly and daily intervals**. The following files are available:

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `2022-2023_60min.xlsx` | Hourly data collected during the initial deployment period (2022-2023). |
| `2023-2024_60min.xlsx` | Hourly data collected after buoy repair and redeployment (2023-2024). |
| `MarMenor_60min.xlsx` | Merged dataset from the two previous hourly data files. |
| `MarMenor_60min_QC.xlsx` | Quality-controlled version of `MarMenor_60min.xlsx` (recommended for use). |
| `2022-2023_Daily.xlsx` | Daily data from the initial deployment period (2022-2023). |
| `2023-2024_Daily.xlsx` | Daily data after the buoy redeployment (2023-2024). |
| `MarMenor_Daily.xlsx` | Merged dataset from the two previous daily data files. |
| `MarMenor_Daily_QC.xlsx` | Quality-controlled version of `MarMenor_Daily.xlsx` (recommended for use). |

üîπ **Note:** The QC (quality-controlled) files are the preferred datasets for analysis, as they have undergone **manual inspection and removal of suspect values**.

## üåä Measured Parameters

The SMARTLAGOON Buoy collects high-frequency **meteorological** and **water quality** measurements, including:

- **Meteorological Data:**
  - Air temperature (¬∞C)
  - Relative humidity (%)
  - Wind speed (m/s)

- **Water Quality Data:**
  - Water temperature (¬∞C) at multiple depths (0.5m, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 6.5m)
  - Dissolved oxygen (mg/L) at different depths
  - Chlorophyll fluorescence (¬µg/L) as an indicator of algal biomass
  - Turbidity (NTU) to assess water clarity
